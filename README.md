# Andrik's Robotics + LeetCode Repository

Welcome! This repository documents my journey in mastering algorithmic problem-solving and robotics programming using **Python**, **C**, and **C++** — with a focus on applying these skills to real-world robotics systems and embedded hardware.

---

## 🧠 Goals

- 🧩 Strengthen core algorithm and data structure skills via LeetCode
- 🤖 Translate programming fluency into robotics control logic
- 🔄 Build and document full-stack robotics systems (ROS nodes, embedded code, planners)
- 🛠 Sharpen both software design and low-level microcontroller work
