## 📌 Notes

- I aim to alternate between **Python** and **C++** to reinforce both languages.
- Each problem will include:
  - A clean solution with comments
  - A `README.md` inside the folder describing the problem and my approach
  - If helpful, complexity analysis

This tracker will be updated weekly as I complete new problems.
